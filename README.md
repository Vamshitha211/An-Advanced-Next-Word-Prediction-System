We leveraged available datasets and frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for model implementation and customized the model by fine-tuning it on specific domains or topics relevant to the application.


Deliverables:
Our project culminated in several key deliverables, including:

Evaluation metrics such as perplexity, accuracy, and context relevance scores to comprehensively assess the model's performance.
A complete codebase with detailed documentation to facilitate streamlined model implementation.
User interface development featuring a user-friendly web-based interface using tools like Flask or Dash, enhancing overall user experience and satisfaction.


Evaluation Methodology:


To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we employed a range of metrics including perplexity, accuracy, and context relevance scores. 
Our experimental setup involved rigorous training, validation, and testing splits, utilizing publicly available datasets such as pizza.txt and other relevant sources. 
Additionally, we benchmarked our model's performance against state-of-the-art models and industry standards to validate its competitiveness and advancements.



CODE


Now lets get into code section 

We started by reading text data which is 'pizza.txt' and split it into individual words.
Then, we made a list of all the unique words in the text and assigned each word a number 
After that, we turned the text into small groups of words, each group containing 50 words. This helps in training the model.

We created a type of model called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) using PyTorch.
We trained our model to understand text data in batches. This means it learns from small groups of data at a time, which is faster and more efficient.
We repeated the training process multiple times (epochs) to improve the model's accuracy.
During training, the model adjusted its settings to make better predictions and minimize errors.

Text Generation:
Once the model is trained, we use it to create new text.
We gave the model a starting phrase, and it predicts the next words based on what it learned from the training data.
We repeated this process to generate longer pieces of text.

Visualization:
To see how well the model is trained, we plotted a graph showing how the training progresses. This helps us to see if the model is improving over time.
We also created a word cloud, looks like a picture made of words. The size of each word in the cloud represents how often it appears in the text data.


2. Pre-trained GPT-2 tokenizer and model

Test 1: Without Word Limit

Setup:
The code utilizes the transformers library to load a pre-trained GPT-2 tokenizer and language model.
Text Generation:
A function generate_text(prompt, max_length=50) is defined to generate text based on a prompt.
The function encodes the prompt, generates text up to a maximum length of 50 tokens, and decodes the output to produce generated text.
Example Usage:
We initialize the prompt as "The pizza is" and generate text without specifying a word limit.
The generated text is printed to the console.
Test 2: With Word Limit

Modification:
We extended the functionality by introducing a word limit parameter to control the length of generated text.
The function generate_text(prompt, num_words=50) is updated to take a word limit as input.
The maximum length for text generation is adjusted based on the number of words in the prompt.
Example Usage:
We set the prompt as "The pizza is" and prompt the user to input the desired number of words for text generation.
The script generates text with the specified word limit 
Both tests demonstrate the capability of the GPT-2 model to generate coherent text based on provided prompts. The modifications in Test 2 offer flexibility by allowing users to control the length of generated text.



3. User Interface

Setup:
The script utilize the transformers library to load a pre-trained GPT-2 tokenizer and language model.

Within the GPT2TextGeneratorCLI class, the generate_text method generates text based on a provided prompt and a specified number of words.
It encodes the prompt, generates text up to the specified word limit, and decodes the output to produce the generated text.

User Interaction:
Upon execution, the CLI prompts the user to enter a prompt for text generation.
The user can also specify the number of words to be generated.
Typing 'exit' terminates the CLI.

Example Usage: â€”----



In conclusion, our project represents a significant step forward in the field of text completion systems.
By harnessing the power of neural language models, we aim to provide users with more accurate and contextually relevant suggestions, thereby enhancing their overall text-based communication experience.
